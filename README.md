# Currency Exchange Scraper

This project is a Python application designed to scrape currency exchange rates from a specified website. It uses web scraping libraries such as `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `fake_useragent` to retrieve and parse data from the target website. The project supports fetching rates for USD and EUR using dedicated functions found in the code file `parser.py`.

## Features

- Retrieve HTML content with a randomized User-Agent.
- Parse and extract currency rates for both USD and EUR.
- Handle different data formats for currencies.
- Basic error handling for network and parsing issues.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Install the required packages using pip. For example:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Environment Variables

The project uses an environment file for configuration. Create a file named `.env` in the root directory and add the following variables:

```dotenv
TOKEN = "your_bot_token"
SUPABASE_URL = "your_supabase_url"
SUPABASE_KEY = "your_supabase_key"
```

Replace the placeholder values with your actual tokens and keys.

## Usage

The main functions are located in `parser.py`:

- `get_usd_prices()`: Fetches and returns exchange rates data for USD.
- `get_eur_prices()`: Fetches and returns exchange rates data for EUR.

You can run the main application (e.g., `main.py`) to execute these functions and use the returned data. 

Example usage in code:

```python
from parser import get_usd_prices, get_eur_prices

usd_rates = get_usd_prices()
eur_rates = get_eur_prices()

print("USD Rates:", usd_rates)
print("EUR Rates:", eur_rates)
```
